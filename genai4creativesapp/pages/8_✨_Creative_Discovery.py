st.markdown("""
**Exercise 1: Prompt for Surprise**  
- Use ChatGPT or another text AI.  
- Input a surreal prompt (e.g., “What advice would a time-traveling toaster give to a lost moon explorer?”)  
- Write a short story based on the output.

**Exercise 2: Remix and Reframe**  
- Use Midjourney or a similar text-to-image model.  
- Try unrelated combinations (e.g., “Jazz-playing jellyfish in a dystopian desert”).  
- Create a visual or storyboard from the output.

**Exercise 3: Creative Constraints Challenge**  
- Use a random word generator to pick 3 constraints.  
- Create a project using all 3 (e.g., song, design, poem, scene).
