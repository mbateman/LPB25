    st.markdown("""
**1. What is the primary goal of neural style transfer?**  
- A) To detect image objects  
- ‚úÖ B) To blend the content of one image with the style of another using deep learning techniques  
- C) To generate high-resolution images  
- D) To segment backgrounds from portraits

**2. Which neural network architecture is commonly used for style transfer?**  
- A) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
- ‚úÖ B) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- C) Transformers  
- D) GANs

**3. In neural style transfer, what does the 'content image' represent?**  
- ‚úÖ A) The image whose structural elements are to be preserved in the final output  
- B) The brushstroke reference  
- C) The target texture  
- D) The style definition

**4. What role does the 'style image' play in neural style transfer?**  
- A) It defines object boundaries  
- B) It controls file compression  
- ‚úÖ C) It provides the artistic style (e.g., brushstrokes, color palette) to be applied to the content image
